# RSVSW - Practical session 4: Time series analysis

## 1 Introduction

The objectives of this session are:

-   Understand key concepts related to time series analysis in the context of monitoring of vegetation dynamics with satellite remote sensing imagery

-   

-   ~~Determine the land cover type of nine Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series by comparing them to reference time series of various land cover types and mark them on the global map (Figure below)~~

-   ~~Examine the decomposed EVI time series and compare their dynamics with Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) time series~~

During this practical session, you won't have to do a lot of coding yourself, instead the focus lies on understanding what the code is doing and interpreting the outputs. You are encouraged to look up unfamiliar functions with `?` or the `help()` function and think about how they fit into these scripts. Answer the questions that are scattered throughout the notebook.

## 2 Packages

As always, we begin by taking care of the packages we need for this session. This piece of code first creates a list containing the required packages and then runs them through a for-loop to check if they are installed or not. If a package is not installed yet, it will be installed with the `install.packages()` function. Afterwards, all the required packages are loaded with the `library()` function.

```{r}
# Create a list with the required packages
requiredPackages <- c("bfast", "scales", "corrplot", "matrixStats", "reshape", "ggplot2", "phenofit","tidyverse")

# Check if required packages are installed; if a package is not installed, install it; then load the packages
for (package in requiredPackages) {
  if (!require(package, character.only=TRUE)) {
    install.packages(package, dependencies=TRUE)
  }
  library(package, character.only=TRUE)
}
```

## 3 Settings

Next, we make sure that we are able to import the provided data easily. Modify `dir_wor` to provide the correct path to the directory where you stored the files for this session. We will load in data from `dir_data` and save intermediate results in `dir_results`.

```{r}
# dir_wor <- "..."
# setwd(dir_wor)
dir_data <- "./Data" # Relative path to the directory where the given data is stored
files <- list.files(dir_data) # Get list of filenames in dir_data
dir_results <- "./results" # Relative path to the directory where results are saved
saveFlag <- TRUE # Set to TRUE if you want to save the output time series
```

## 4 Load data

In this session, we will work with a product derived from [MODIS](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/modis-overview/) imagery named [MOD13A2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD13A3) and with potential drivers for vegetation response, being [monthly mean temperature from ERA5 reanalysis](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_MONTHLY) and a [SPEI drought index](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CSIC_SPEI_2_9) which you can download using a [GEE script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/b93ad1ebbb11e2cd3d1328c1dd31e2f3).

MODIS ([Mod]{.underline}erate-resolution [I]{.underline}maging [S]{.underline}pectroradiomater) is a satellite-based sensor on board of the the Aqua and Terra satellites. The sensor captures 36 spectral bands ranging from 400 nm to 1440 nm at varying spatial resolutions (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). Since 2000, the two sensors provide global coverage every 1 to 2 days.

The MOD13A3 product provides 16-day composites for two Vegetation Indices (VIs) at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the second one is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. We will use EVI time series data is this session.

The `files` variable contains the file names of all the files we will use today. Below you can find a description of these data.

We have nine time series with unknown [l]{.underline}and [c]{.underline}over [t]{.underline}ypes (lct):

-   **unk_EVI_ts** contains nine EVI time series with unknown land cover types

-   **unk_EVI_qual** contains VI Quality Assurance (QA) values of the nine time series with unknown land cover types, expressed at bit flags that can be covered to integer values; the table below contains the meaning of the values

-   **unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas** contains the "start of season" seasonality parameter for the time series with unknown land cover types calculated with the [TIMESAT](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306166995_TIMESAT_A_Software_Package_for_Time-Series_Processing_and_Assessment_of_Vegetation_Dynamics) algorithm, expressed as DOY (Day Of Year)

-   **unk_EVI_timesat_midSeas** contains the "middle of season" seasonality parameter for the time series with unknown land cover types calculated with the [TIMESAT](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306166995_TIMESAT_A_Software_Package_for_Time-Series_Processing_and_Assessment_of_Vegetation_Dynamics){style="font-size: 11pt;"} algorithm, expressed as DOY (Day Of Year)

-   **unk_EVI_timesat_endSeas** contains the "end of season" seasonality parameter for the time series with unknown land cover types calculated with the [TIMESAT](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306166995_TIMESAT_A_Software_Package_for_Time-Series_Processing_and_Assessment_of_Vegetation_Dynamics){style="font-size: 11pt;"} algorithm, expressed as DOY (Day Of Year)

We have 16 "reference" time series with known land cover types:

-   **ref_EVI_ts** contains EVI time series of 16 reference land cover types

-   **ref_ECI_seas** contains the seasonality of 16 reference land cover types

-   **ref_lct_names** contains a list with the names of 16 reference land cover types

Climatic data:

-   **unk_spei** contains Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration (SPEI) time series for the nine time series with unknown land cover types

The files in the Data folder were originally created in R using the `save()` function. The `load()` function allows to reload such data. `load()` takes as input an argument `file` which should contain a character string with the path to the file to load. This string can be constructed easily with the `file.path()` function which allows you to construct the path to a file. Now let's actually load in the data.

```{r}
# Load files
for (f in files) {
  load(file=file.path(dir_data, f))
}
```

### 4.1 Load MODIS data

```{r}
# Read the CSV file for the MODIS data 
MOD <- read.csv("Data/MODIS_time_series.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Process the 'values' column
parsed_values <- sapply(MOD$values, function(x) {
  # Extract key-value pairs from the string
  pairs <- gsub("\\{|\\}", "", strsplit(gsub("=", ":", x), ", ")[[1]])
  # Convert key-value pairs to a named vector
  as.numeric(unlist(lapply(strsplit(pairs, ":"), function(pair) pair[2])))
})

# Assign values to new columns
MOD$EVI <- parsed_values[1, ]
MOD$NDVI <- parsed_values[2, ]
MOD$QA <- parsed_values[3, ]
MOD$pixel=substr(MOD$system.index,12,13)

# Create a EVI, NDVI and QA data frame
EVI = data.frame(MOD$date,MOD$EVI,MOD$pixel)
NDVI = data.frame(MOD$date,MOD$NDVI,MOD$pixel)
QA = data.frame(MOD$date,MOD$QA,MOD$pixel)

# Convert to a matrix structure
EVI = pivot_wider(EVI, names_from = MOD.pixel, values_from = MOD.EVI)
NDVI = pivot_wider(NDVI, names_from = MOD.pixel, values_from = MOD.NDVI)
QA = pivot_wider(QA, names_from = MOD.pixel, values_from = MOD.QA)

```

### 4.2 Load ERA5 temperature data

```{r}
# Read the CSV file
ERA <- read.csv("Data/ERA5T_time_series.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Process the 'values' column
parsed_values <- sapply(ERA$values, function(x) {
  # Extract key-value pairs from the string
  pairs <- gsub("\\{|\\}", "", strsplit(gsub("=", ":", x), ", ")[[1]])
  # Convert key-value pairs to a named vector
  as.numeric(unlist(lapply(strsplit(pairs, ":"), function(pair) pair[2])))
})

# Assign values to new columns
ERA$t2m <- parsed_values
ERA$pixel=substr(ERA$system.index,8,8)

# Create a EVI, NDVI and QA data frame
ERA = data.frame(ERA$date,ERA$t2m,ERA$pixel)

# Convert to a matrix structure
ERA = pivot_wider(ERA, names_from = ERA.pixel, values_from = ERA.t2m)
```

### 4.3 Load SPEI drought data

```{r}
# Read the CSV file
SPEI <- read.csv("Data/SPEI_time_series.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Process the 'values' column
parsed_values <- sapply(SPEI$values, function(x) {
  # Extract key-value pairs from the string
  pairs <- gsub("\\{|\\}", "", strsplit(gsub("=", ":", x), ", ")[[1]])
  # Convert key-value pairs to a named vector
  as.numeric(unlist(lapply(strsplit(pairs, ":"), function(pair) pair[2])))
})

# Assign values to new columns
SPEI$spei <- parsed_values
SPEI$pixel=substr(SPEI$system.index,12,13)

# Create a EVI, NDVI and QA data frame
SPEI = data.frame(SPEI$date,SPEI$spei,SPEI$pixel)

# Convert to a matrix structure
SPEI = pivot_wider(SPEI, names_from = SPEI.pixel, values_from = SPEI.spei)
```

##  Functions

In this section we define a function `ConvertBitWordVIQ` that we use when pre-processing the time series. The MOD13 product includes bands with Quality Assurance (QA) flags that say something about the pixel quality. We will use this function to convert the bitwords to integer values so that we can use them to mask out noisy pixels. Run the R chunk to load the function into your environment.

```{r}
# Input: QA - a matrix containing bitwords
bitsToInt <- function(x) {
  packBits(rev(c(rep(FALSE, 32-length(x)%%32), as.logical(x))), "integer")
}
```

## 6 Exercises

### Step 1 Data exploration

#### **1.1** Explore the data

Check out the dimensions of the matrices that contain the time series with `dim()`. Each row represents a time series and each column represents a time step.

```{r}
dim(EVI)
dim(ERA)
dim(SPEI)
```

#### 1.2 Visualize the time series data

Now we plot the nine time series with unknown land cover types. We chose to name the time series with letters from A to I. We use `par(mfrow=c(3,3))` to split the plot screen in nine panels (three by three) so we can plot the time series in one window. The `ts()` function is used to convert the `numeric` objects into objects of class `ts`, which stand for time series. The `plot.ts()` function is used to plot the `ts` objects.

Notice the ranges of the y-axes:

-   We expect EVI values to range between -1 and 1, but here the values are much higher. This suggests that these data have not properly scaled yet, and we still have to apply a scale factor to the data. We will do this later.

-   The graphs are difficult to compare because the range of the y-axis is not the same in each graph. In the next graphs, we will manually set a fixed range range for the y-axis.

```{r}
# Create a list of titles for the plots
unk_lct_names <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I")

# Plot the time series in variable unk_EVI_ts
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:(ncol(EVI)-1)) {
  tm <- ts(EVI[,i+1], start=c(2002,1,1), frequency=12)
  ts.plot(tm, gpars=list(xlab="Time", ylab="EVI", main=unk_lct_names[i], 
                         pch=c(5,2), lty=c(1,1), col=c("red"))
          )
}
```

### Step 2 Pre-processing

#### **2.1 Re-scaling and dealing with NAs**

The first column of the `EVI` variable contains NA values.

The MOD13C2 product has a valid data range of -2000 to 10000 and a scale factor of 0.0001. Fill in the correct values of the lower and upper limit, and multiply the time series with the scale factor. Do this by replacing the incorrect -9999 values.

```{r}
# Create copy of intermediate result
EVI_ts_sc <- as.data.frame(EVI[,2:ncol(EVI)]) # "sc" for "scaled"

# Set nan values to NA
# EVI_ts_sc[is.nan(EVI_ts_sc) == T] <- NA

# Set data outside valid range EVI as NaN
EVI_ts_sc[EVI_ts_sc < -2000] <- NA # Provide the lower limit
EVI_ts_sc[EVI_ts_sc > 10000] <- NA # Provide the upper limit

# Multiply with scale factor
EVI_ts_sc <- EVI_ts_sc*0.0001 # Provide the scale factor
```

Check if the EVI values now indeed range between -1 and 1.

#### **2.2 Masking out noisy observations**

```{r}
# Convert VI quality bit words to integer values
QAindicators <- ConvertBitWordVIQ(QA)
```

Next, set low quality data as NA. The 'QAindicators' variable shows the names of the QA indicators. Search in Table 1.1 to choose which low quality data you want to set as missing. Note that not all flags are equally relevant. An example code line for mixed clouds is given. Choose which other quality flags you would like to mask out. Repeat and adapt the code for other quality flags.

```{r T1.3}
# Create copy of intermediate result
EVI_ts_sc_mk = EVI_ts_sc # "mk" for "masked"
QA2 = QA[,2:ncol(QA)]
msk = apply(QA2, FUN=function(x) {bitsToInt(as.integer(intToBits(x)[1:2])[2:1])},MARGIN=c(1,2))

# Set low quality data as missing
EVI_ts_sc_mk[msk > 0] <- NA 
# If QA flag "mixed clouds" equals 1, set to NA
```

Be careful, some flags are very strict and remove almost all the data. You can check this by visualizing the data in the next chunk. The key is finding a balance between removing noise and retaining information. There are no clear-cut general rules on this.

#### 2.3 Visualize

Now that low quality data has been set as missing, plot the nine time series again and see what change

```{r}
# Create a list of titles for the plots
unk_lct_names <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I")

# Plot the time series in variable EVI_ts
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:ncol(EVI_ts_sc_mk)) {
  tm <- ts(EVI_ts_sc_mk[,i], start=c(2002,1,1), frequency=12)
  ts.plot(tm, gpars=list(xlab="Time", ylab="EVI", main=unk_lct_names[i], 
                         pch=c(5,2), lty=c(1,1), col=c("red"),ylim=c(0,0.9))
          )
}
```

```{r}
# Save the processed time series
if (saveFlag) {
  save(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk, file=paste0(dir_results, "/EVI_ts_sc_mk"))
}
```

**Answer the following questions:**

-   **Q2.2** What happens when more and more data is set as missing? How does that influence the quality of the time series data?

### Step 3 Time series decomposition

#### **3.1 Calculate seasonality, trend and remainder**

In this step, we decompose the time series by extracting the seasonality, trend and remainder. Here, the decomposition is based on an additive model: **time series = seasonality + trend + remainder**.

-   The **seasonality** is calculated by taking the mean of observations on the same day of all the years present in the time series; NA values are omitted from the calculation.

-   The **trend** is based on linear regression

-   The **remainder** is based on subtracting the seasonality and trend from the time series

```{r}
## Preparation

# Save dimensions of EVI_ts
nc <- dim(EVI_ts_sc_mk)[1] # = number of rows/time series/observations
nr <- dim(EVI_ts_sc_mk)[2] # = number of columns/time steps

# Create dataframe filled with NA values with the required dimensions
seasonality <- matrix(NA, nrow=nc, ncol=nr)
remainder <- matrix(NA, nrow=nc, ncol=nr) 
trend <- matrix(NA, nrow=nr, ncol=3)

# Seasonality
for (i in 1:12) {
  seasonality[seq(i,nc,12),] <- rowMeans(EVI_ts_sc_mk[seq(i,nc,12),], na.rm=T)
}

## Trend & Remainder
EVI_ts_sc_mk_ds <- EVI_ts_sc_mk - seasonality # deseasonalized time series

for (i in 1:dim(EVI_ts_sc_mk_ds)[2]) {
  x <- seq_along(EVI_ts_sc_mk_ds[,i])
  fit0 <- lm(EVI_ts_sc_mk_ds[,i] ~ x)
  trend[i,1] <- fit0$coefficients[1] # intercept
  trend[i,2] <- fit0$coefficients[2] # slope
  trend[i,3] <- summary(fit0)$coefficients[2,4] # p value slope
  if (trend[i,3] < 0.05) {
    remainder[,i] <- EVI_ts_sc_mk_ds[,i]-
      (trend[i,1]+trend[i,2]*x)+
      mean(EVI_ts_sc_mk_ds[,i], na.rm=T)
  }
  else { 
    remainder[,i] <- EVI_ts_sc_mk_ds[,i]
    }
}
```

#### **3.2 Visualize**

```{r}
# Plot EVI_ts_sc_mk and seasonality and tr
par(mfrow=c(3,3)) # all plots on one page
for (i in 1:dim(EVI_ts_sc_mk)[1]) {
  tr <- trend[i,1]+trend[i,2]*(1:nc) + mean(EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], na.rm=T)
  tm <- ts(cbind(EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], seasonality[i,], tr), 
           start=c(2000,1,1), frequency=12)
  ts.plot(tm, gpars=list(xlab="Time", ylab="EVI", main=unk_lct_names[i], ylim=c(-0.2,1), 
                         pch=c(5,2),lty=c(1,1), col=c("black","red","green")))
}
```

**Answer the following questions:**

-   **Q3.1** What do the black, green, and red lines represent?

-   **Q3.2** What is the biological meaning of the seasonality, the trend and the remainder? Which non-biological influences might also have an impact?

### Step 4 Breakpoint detection

In this step, we will use the `bfast01()` function of the `bfast` package to check whether one major break in the time series. `bfast01` is an implementation of the original `bfast` algorithm, but instead of detecting multiple breaks in a time series, it is designed to detect one major break in the seasonality or trend component of a time series. Here, we run the function with its default settings.

#### 4.1 Apply bfast01

First we will apply `bfast01()` for one of the time series so that we can explore the output a bit.

```{r}
# Get bfast output for time series A
bfast_result <- bfast01(ts(EVI_ts_sc_mk[1,], start=c(2000,1,1), freq=12))

# Explore the bfast01 output
print(bfast_result$breaks)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(bfast_result)
```

#### 4.2 Apply bfast01 and visualize results

```{r}
# Apply bfast01 on time series A-I and plot output
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:dim(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk)[1]) {
  bf <- bfast01(ts(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], start=c(2000,1,1), freq=12))
  plot(bf, main=unk_lct_names[i])
}
```

-   **Q4.1** Which time series show a break? What could cause breaks and trend shifts?
-   **Q4.2** Would it be useful to test the occurrence and timing of breaks in the SPEI dataset as well?

### Step 5 Similarity measures

#### 5.1 Calculate similarity measures

In this step, we calculate three distance-based (dis)similarity measures -- based on Fourier distance, Miskowski distance and pairwise correlation -- between the time series with unknown land cover types and the reference time series. The measures are scaled between -1 and 1. Based on these plots, determine which land cover type is most likely associated with each time series. The 16 optional land cover types are given in the `ref_lct_names` variable.

Find more information on these measures in *Lhermitte et al., 2011, Remote Sensing of Environment 115, 3129-3152.*

```{r}
# Create dataframe filled with NA values with the required dimensions
dist_Four <- matrix(NA, nrow=9, ncol=16)
dist_Corr <- matrix(NA, nrow=9, ncol=16)
dist_Mink <- matrix(NA, nrow=9, ncol=16)

for (i in 1:9) {
  for (j in 1:16) {
    # Fourier analysis requres time series without missing values
    x <- x <- seq_along(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,])
    ts_inp <- unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,]
    ts_inp[is.na(ts_inp)] <- approx(x, ts_inp, x[is.na(ts_inp)])$y
    minx <- max(which(is.na(ts_inp[1:75])), 0)+1
    maxx <- min(which(is.na(ts_inp[75:156])), 157)-1
    ref_inp <- ref_EVI_seas[j,]
    ref_inp[is.na(ref_inp)] <- approx(x, ref_inp, x[is.na(ref_inp)])$y
    
    # Computation of (dis)similarity measures
    dist_Four[i,j] <- FourierDistance(ts_inp[minx:maxx], ref_inp[minx:maxx],3)
    dist_Corr[i,j] <- cor(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], ref_EVI_seas[j,], 
                          use="pairwise.complete.obs")
    dist_Mink[i,j] <- dist(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], ref_EVI_seas[j,], p=2, 
                           method="Minkowski", by_rows=F)
  }
}

# Scale measures between -1 and 1
dist_Mink <- dist_Mink/max(abs(dist_Mink))
dist_Four <- dist_Four/max(abs(dist_Four), na.rm=T)
```

#### 5.2 Visualize

```{r}
# Plot (dis)similarity values
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
# Correlation
corrplot(dist_Corr, method="color",  
         addCoef.col="black",
         tl.col="black", tl.srt=45,
         title="Correlation plot", mar=c(0,0,1,0))
# Mink distance
corrplot(dist_Mink, method="color",  
         addCoef.col="black",
         tl.col="black", tl.srt=45,
         title="Mink distance", mar=c(0,0,1,0))
# Fourier distance
corrplot(dist_Four, method="color",  
         addCoef.col="black",
         tl.col="black", tl.srt=45,
         title="Fourier distance", mar=c(0,0,1,0))
```

-   **Q5.1** Could you also use the seasonality instead of the EVI time series to obtain the land cover types? What would be the (dis)advantages?

-   **Q5.2** Do all similarity give the same results? Explain

-   **Q5.3** Which land cover type is likely associated with each of the nine time series? Try to locate them on the map

### Step 6 Phenology

#### 6.1 Visualize seasonality measures

In this step, we look at some seasonality measures of the time series. More specifically, the start, mid and end of the growing season for each time series as well as their mean and standard deviation. Due to missing values, there are no results for time series F.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:dim(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk)[1]) {
  # Convert DOY to
  xs <- 2000 + (((unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas[i,]-1)/364*11) +
                  ((seq_along(unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas[i,])-1)*12))/12
  xm <- 2000 + (((unk_EVI_timesat_midSeas[i,]-1)/364*11) +
                  ((seq_along(unk_EVI_timesat_midSeas[i,])-1)*12))/12
  xe <- 2000 + (((unk_EVI_timesat_endSeas[i,]-1)/364*11) +
                  ((seq_along(unk_EVI_timesat_endSeas[i,])-1)*12))/12
  # Get corresponding EVI value
  ys <- approx(2000 + (0:155)/12, unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], xs)$y
  ym <- approx(2000 + (0:155)/12, unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], xm)$y
  ye <- approx(2000 + (0:155)/12, unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,], xe)$y

  # Plot time series with seasonality measures
  tm <- ts(unk_EVI_ts_sc_mk[i,],
           start=c(2000,1,1), frequency=12)
  ts.plot(tm, gpars=list(xlab="Time", ylab="EVI", main=unk_lct_names[i],
                         pch=c(5,2), lty=c(1,1), col=c("black","red")))
  points(xs, ys, pch=19, col=c("red")) # Add start of season as points
  points(xm, ym, pch=19, col=c("green")) # Add mid of season as points
  points(xe, ye, pch=19, col=c("blue")) # Add end of season as points
}
```

#### 6.2 Visualize variability seasonality measures

Here we will compare the variability of the seasonality measures for the time series with unknown land cover types across the years included in the time series. R will throw a warning because the data for time series F is missing. You can ignore that warning.

```{r}
## Start of season
# Get rowMeans of unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas
unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_rowMeans <- rowMeans(unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas, na.rm=T)
# Get rowSds (standard deviation) of unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas
unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_rowSds <- rowSds(unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas, na.rm=T)
# Create dataframe with column names, mean start and mean start +/- standard deviation
unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_data <- as.data.frame(cbind(as.factor(unk_lct_names), 
                                                      unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_rowMeans, 
                                                      unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_rowMeans -
                                                        unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_rowSds, 
                                                      unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_rowMeans + 
                                                        unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_rowSds))
# Change column names of dataframe
colnames(unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_data) <- c("names", "rowMeans", 
                                              "rowMeansMinussd", "rowMeansPlussd")
# Plot bar plots of the mean start of the growning period with error bars
p <- ggplot(data=unk_EVI_timesat_startSeas_data, 
            aes(x=unk_lct_names, y=rowMeans))
p + geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=rowMeansMinussd, ymax=rowMeansPlussd), width=0.25) + 
  xlab("Time series") + 
  ylab("Mean start of growing period") +
  ylim(0,550)

# You can copy and adapt the code for Middle of season and End of seasion
```

**Answer the following questions:**

-   **Q6.1** Is the inter-annual variability of the phenology high for each of the land cover types? What could determine this variability?

-   **Q6.2** Compare the phenology metrics of the land cover types. Explain.

### Step 7 Remainder

In this final step, we take a closer look at the remainder.

#### 7.1 Calculate the standard deviation of the remainder

Calculate the standard deviation fo the remainder.

```{r}
# Calculate the standard deviation of the remainder
sd_rem <- rowSds(remainder, na.rm=T)
print(sd_rem)
```

-   **Q7.1** Interpret the standard deviation of the remainder. What would influence this metric?

### Step 8 SPEI

#### 8.1 Visualize

First, we visualize the Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) time series. The SPEI is a widely used drought index based on climatic data. It is designed to take into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. In this way, it captures the main impact of increased temperatures on water demand. Positive values indicate wet conditionals, while negative values indicate dry conditions.

```{r}
# Plot the time series in variable unk_EVI_ts
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:nrow(unk_spei)) {
  tm <- ts(unk_spei[i,], start=c(2000,1,1), frequency=12)
  ts.plot(tm, gpars=list(xlab="Time", ylab="EVI", main=unk_lct_names[i], ylim=c(-2,2.5), 
                         pch=c(5,2), lty=c(1,1), col=c("black"))
          )
  abline(h=0)
}
```

#### **8.2** Correlate the remainder with the SPEI drought index

Calculate the cross correlation of the remainder with the SPEI index.

```{r}
# Create 
corr_rem <- matrix(NA, dim(remainder)[1], 1)

for (i in 1:dim(remainder)[1]) {
  corr_rem[i,] <- cor(remainder[i,1:144], unk_spei[i,], 
                      use="pairwise.complete.obs")
}
print(corr_rem)
```

-   **Q8.1** Interpret the cross correlation with the drought index. Would you expect this result?

-   **Q8.2** What is the advantage/disadvantage of using remote sensing time series compared to mono-temporal approaches? And compared to bi-temporal approaches?
